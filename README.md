### Glad to see you here! &nbsp;

I'm a backend developer with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for solving real-world problems through technology.  
I recently graduated and am currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can grow as an engineer and make meaningful contributions.

Lately, I'm building a real-time **online ping pong game** using **Kubernetes**, **Kafka**, and **event-driven architecture (EDA)**.  
This project reflects my interest in distributed systems, real-time communication, and scalable backend design.

Iâ€™m a purpose-driven, creative thinker who enjoys diving deep into new technologies and continuously improving my skill set.  
My experience spans backend, frontend, DevOps, and even mobile â€” a true hexagonal developer at heart.  
When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me reading about personal development or exploring new ideas across different fields.
